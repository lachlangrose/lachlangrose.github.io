Biography
---------
I am a postdoc research fellow at Monash University working on the Loop project. My research interests are 3D geological modelling methods and integrating structural geology into 3D modelling methods. I currently lead the 3D modelling team for the Loop project where I have led the development of [LoopStructural](www.github.com/Loop3d/LoopStructural) a Python library for 3D geological modelling. I completed my PhD ‘Forward and inverse modelling of Geological Folds’ in 2018.   

I am a believer in open source software and reproducible examples in publications. I have been involved in the development of a number of [different libraries and plugins](software). On this website I will publish tips and tricks for python development, new research and guides for using my code.
