    "The Mountain bike park planned for Warburton has been extremely controversial due to environmental concerns. An Environment Effects Statement including a community feedback was conducted in late 2021 and the community feedback was released in early 2022. There were over 2500 submissions from the general public, including mountain bike riders and environmentalists. I decided to analyse the text in every submission with the aim of classifying it as positive or negative. To do this the ess results needed to be downloaded from the repository holding them, the pdf files need to be converted into plain text and the results analysed for the sentiment. All of this work will be performed with Python.\n"
