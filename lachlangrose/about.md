My name is Lachlan Grose. 
I am a structural geologist interested in integrating structural geology into three dimensional geometrical modelling of geological features. 
I am currently a researcher working at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. 
I completed my Ph.D. thesis early in 2018 titled `Forward and Inverse Modeling of Geological Folds'. 

I am currently working as a postdoc with the Loop consortium [Loop](http://loop3d.org/) where I am focusing on structural modeling fault networks with applications in polydeformed terranes. 

I am on github:
